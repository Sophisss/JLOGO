# LOGO
The program developed in Java provides an implementation of the Logo program.
Logo is used to create drawings within a drawing area, generated by moving a cursor.
The area where the product design is realized consists of a portion of the floor having finite dimensions (base, height).
The coordinate (0,0) indicates the lower left point of the plane. The central position (called home) has coordinates (base / 2, height / 2).
Cursor movement is defined by means of a program which consists of a list of instructions, such as forward, backward, up, down, etc. During the movement of the cursor, if the pen is attached to the sheet it generates segments, and if the segments are consecutive and rejoin the initial starting point, these form a closed area or a polygon.
